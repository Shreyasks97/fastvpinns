# FastVPINNs - Examples
---

This folder contains examples of how to use the FastVPINNs package. The examples are divided into two categories:
- [Forward Problem](./forward_problems_2d/): Examples of solving forward problems in 2D.
- [Inverse Problem](./inverse_problems_2d/): Examples of solving inverse problems in 2D.

## Forward Problems 2D
---
This section has examples on how to solve forward problems in 2D using the FastVPINNs for PDEs such as Poisson, Helmholtz, and CD2D equations. It has geometries for both internal and external meshes. 

## Inverse Problems 2D
---
This section has examples on how to solve inverse problems in 2D using the FastVPINNs for PDEs such as Poisson, CD2D equations. This has both the examples for problems with constant coefficients and spatially varying coefficients.

## Notebooks to get started with FastvPINNs
---
This section contains notebooks prepared for the preconference workshop on Scientific Machine Learning at the International Conference on Applied AI and Scientific Machine Learning ([CASML 2024](https://casml.cc/)). 
- A starter notebook on solving the Poisson equation using FastVPINNs can be found [here](./notebooks/poisson_training.ipynb) and can be opened on Google Colab <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/cmgcds/fastvpinns/blob/main/examples/notebooks/poisson_training.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
